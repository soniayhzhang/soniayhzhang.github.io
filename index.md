####Happy Chinese New Year everyone!####

This is my portfolio website for the course "Design in Safaries". And my first website ever! I am an anthropology student trying to figure out interaction design, technology, boundaries between humans and non-humans... 
This site is supposed to look better, but it is Chinese New Year so please bear with me for a while. Right now I wouldn't explore this site too much...
