### Welcome. Make yourself at home.

This is my portfolio website for the course "Design in Safaris". And my first website ever! 
I am an anthropology student trying to figure out interaction design, technology, boundaries between humans and non-humans... 
I also want to learn as much as I can on how to make a website, a project, a thing, anything.

**Here are the links to my projects.**
