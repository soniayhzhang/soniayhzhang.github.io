- Body Stroming
- Photos and videos!

- Imagine an ideal prototype: form, material, context(situation), behaviour, message conveyed
- Thinking exercise: why would my cranes care? What is the anthromorphism embedded in this? What is enrichment? What is engagement? Does it provoke anything?

***Feb 23, Sat***

To do list:
- What has already been done for enrichemnt? Compile findings with analysis
- Sofia helped me sort out the materials, circuit and CODES! I will use servo motors to do what I want. 
- I have got most of the materials I want...but what strategy should I use??
- Make good sketches of the prototype, good enough to be uploaded online
- Start to make the **form**!!!
- What are the limits of my prototype? What are the occasions in which animals won't be bothered to interact? What assumptions have embedded my design?
- what behaviour am I aimng for?

### Quick facts about crane life and behaviours:
- life span: 20-50 years
- habitat: wetlands and grasslands
- food: omnivorous — spanning from grasses, insects to aquatic life
- major behaviours studied:
  - dancing (prosocial and playful behaviour)
  - reproduction: courtship rituals, nesting, parental care
  - migration
  - signalling (communication systems)
  - preening (common and time-consuming)
  - roosting (highly regular behaviour according to sunrise and sunset)


### What am I enriching? Why is it meaningful?

In my preliminary proposal, I was planning to either provide them with a **“niche”** or a **“colour-changing block”**. While the former seems too ambitious as the concept risks designing an entire ecosystem containing multiple artefacts, the latter cannot be justified because limited studies are done on cranes’ visual perceptions.  

However, I still find the term ***“niche”*** useful, in this context referring to the collection of resources and competitors that are relevant to an individual’s material life. It is a more useful concept than environment and place, because *several species can occupy different niches, and therefore avoid competition and resource overlap, within the same physical space*. This can be achieved through specialising in specific food, using specific nesting materials, etc. Cranes are known as a **flexible** species which would alter their diets to take advantage of current resources - this makes me wonder whether they are also open to introduced living structures and spaces.

Taking a closer look to crane’s behavioural research and existing enrichment programs, a lot point out that despite being social and having a complex communication system, cranes are shy animals that prefer **spaces for hiding**, both at zoos and in wilderness. 

For example, an enrichment attempt proves crowned cranes’ preference for hiding behind plantations:

>The International Crane Foundation’s Black Crowned Cranes Djoudj (pronounced “Jude”) and Sahel with their “exhibit furniture,” or cut, dried prairie grasses in buckets of sand. Alyssa notes that the cranes “like to hide behind them and also pull the grasses out and toss them around. It’s one of their favourite activities, really.” 

###### From [savingcranes.org](savingcranes.org)

A paper based on observation at wetland reserves in China reveal similar findings: among the six factors determining white-caped cranes’ habitat selection, two are related to safety — protection and concealment:

> Adult white-naped cranes guard the nest and eggs during incubation and hatching…he height of remnant reeds (124.36±13.99 cm) was greater than the body height of incubating white-naped cranes. If a crane stretched its neck when sitting on the nest or stood on the nest, the reeds con- cealed both the nest and the incubating adult. Thus the density and height of remnant reeds were also favorable as protection for cranes during the nesting period. (Wu et al. 2014: p.950)

> White-naped crane is sensitive to disturbances caused by man and domestic animals because of its timid nature, especially during incubation. To reduce extraneous disturbances and increase nesting success, nesting away from an interference region (2.05±0.12 km) was an adaptive strategy for white-naped cranes. (Wu et al. 2014: p.951)

***

Based on the information above, I have decided to try enriching the niche of cranes by creating a **hiding device**, composed of familiar materials such as **grass and reeds**. However, providing a heap of plantation is redundant in a wild environment where cranes already care to reside; to go beyond this, *an interactive element* is needed.

Content and Form: My idea is to design an installation where a heap of grass will expand itself and become an ideal hiding space when an individual approaches, sensed by **an ultrasonic sensor**. The expansion will be enabled by a **[???]**, and it will close when the crane distances itself from the heap. The expansive motion is inspired from the **signalling dances** that cranes exhibit, which frequently involve spreading of wings and rising of necks. Although the meaning of them are mixed depending on the circumstance and combination of postures, I postulate here that spreading motions are more likely to be attended by cranes, triggered by their social tendencies. This will make them react to the spreading and closing of grasses depending on their distance from the device, inviting **interactions and tentative communications**. 

Situation: While literature suggests that cranes prefer to forage at open spaces and hide during nesting and roosting, the need to hide from predators might still persist during foraging, so in an ideal situation I would install the device at both food-abundant **open-spaces** and **roosting sites**.

In order to invite cranes to interact with the device, food might be placed among the grasses or social calls might be played from an external device hidden in the body. However, these are only suggestions and the impact on their behaviours and social recognition should be carefully assessed before implementation. It should also be designed with caution because the device’s purpose might become ambiguous when it serves as both a hiding site, a feeding station and a social experiment.

***Assignment proposal for Feb 19, Tue***

***What does animal enrichment mean when it is not limited to individuals in captivity?***
***How to engage with animals in their natural habitats, influenced but not completely controlled by humans?***

***In this process, how to remain reflexive of our anthropocentric consequences of our interventions?***

**Keeping these questions in mind, I offer a brief sketch of two animal enrichment proposals, both for cranes, whom I also had [my first ethogram experience](/2019-02-03-week-3.md) with.**

### 1. Expanding behavioural niche

While cranes consume a wide range of food, when they co-reside with other species they tend to occupy a specific **niche** to minimise competition. Human modification of landscape has undoubtedly influenced the environmental affordance in which cranes can live with, and thereby limits their niche and increases the likelihood for niche overlap. Following this line, it could  be said that creating a new niche is a moral responsibility to account for *human-induced vulnerability* on this species. 

The goal of “niche design” is not to produce an artefact but to provide the species with a living environment constituent of their ecosystem. Introducing a new source of foodstuff is not sustainable, but it might be possible to introduce **a physical structure that a crane might be willing to dwell**. This living structure should provide the functions of a shelter, camouflage and even mating/child-bearing place. It should be made of **bio-degradable materials** with visual effects, textures and smells that are familiar to cranes’ sensory apparatus. It could also act as a foraging site if the product is developed to attract certain kinds of food source, let it be animal preys or plant-based entities. However, it is important to be cautious of the ethical consequences of prey provision as Newberry (1995: 239) points out.

### 2. Introducing artefacts for play

Acts of animal enrichment without functional relevance (i.e. causes improvement in survival, health indicators, social indicators, etc.) seem hard to justify, however, evidence suggests that behaviours that seem functionless can provide functional benefits to the performer (Newberry 1995: 233). I also argue that the introduction a new functional behaviour into wilderness can bear serious consequences on the **evolutionary dynamics** of not only the target animal species, but also those within the entire ecosystem, which could quickly get out of control from human interveners. 
	
I argue that introducing **playful elements** into the environment acts as a compromise to the potentially more effective i.e. functional forms of animal enrichment. Although animal play remains an under-explored area, let alone crane-specific studies, I propose to design an object that interacts with the crane’s pecking behaviours in terms of visual effects. For example, **a block** that changes colour every time it is being pecked. This comes from the observation of cranes constantly pecking around their habitats in my ethogram observation, as well as the fact that cranes visually display themselves over breeding season. While the first one helps me infer that pecking is not only functional but also an exploratory behaviour, the later proves that visual cues do serve an important function for crane’s livelihood. I am aware that this proposal is prone to anthropomorphic assumptions about their behavioural repertoire.
