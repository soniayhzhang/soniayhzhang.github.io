	<h1>Happy Chinese New Year everyone!</h1>
	<p>I am an anthropology student trying to figure out interaction design, technology, boundaries between humans and non-humans... This site is supposed to look better, but it is Chinese New Year so please bear with me for a little longer.  <em> Right now I wouldn't explore this site too much...</em> ;). <a href="/blog.html"> Take a look at my projects.</a></p>
