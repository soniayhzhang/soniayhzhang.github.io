Under construction!

- What is empathy, really? What is the purpose of feeling other beings' perceptions? More specifically, senses?
- What are the ethical implications of empathy machine? As designers we are introducing a new sensory experience to users, something completely new to them - they are relying on our expertise to renew their conceptions of animals. If we make an inaccurate translation, to what extent are we responsible for its implications?
- How about machines that empathise pain? Pain is a powerful feeling that triggers a sense of commonness and unity. However, does ethical constrains limit us from developing such ideas?
- How to have a concept that matters? A non-random feeling, moving beyond the sense of curiosity?

Conceptualising...
- What do I want to empathise?
  - Sociality: can we experience the social universe of an animal through our sensory percrptions? Social learning is a cognitive process, many scientists would say. But can we mimic the sense of connectivity, bond, urgency to respond...that are described as the instinct for many animals?
- Why is this important?
  - Human is frequently described as a social animal, that advanced sociality is what made us human. The primacy of social interaction, the longing for social bonds might be something shared between us and animals. In this case, I am not trying to make people experience something new and novel senses, but rather to trigger something deep in common, translated to the five senses of the human faculty. 
    - For example, kin recognition through statistical learning is shared through multiple animal species; some comparative psychologists believe human infants share the same learning mechanism.
 - Social connections also expose animals' vulnerabilities. In many contexts, offspring respond to their species-specific callings no matter how much life-threatening danger is embedded in their environments. Moving to an animal welfare perspective, industrial noises that humans create in the anthropocene can seriously disrupt social recognition cues in one's environments, leading to behaviours that are not supposed to be triggered.  
 - While this empathy machine project is an attempt to "allow a human to experience animal senses/locomotion or other animal processes" (copied from assignment page), I believe our course's overall aim is to move beyond the framework of human/animal as two mutually exclusive domains, and reconsider the interactions, entanglements and relationships between human and animals. Examining the interactions themselves requires a rigorous sense of connectivity, and I believe trying to comprehend each others' sense of socail connectedness could be a good start.
- How feasible is this?
  - If social connection is felt through instinct instead of interpretation of meaning, as us humans experience, how can I create something that empathises instinct? Can instinct of another species be felt? Is instinct truly a mechanistic response to external stimuli? Does it also involve some kind of consciousness and thinking process that science nowadays is simply ill-equipped to discover and measure? I hope this ptototype opens this question to the user. It is not to provide an accurate mimic of social connection, but to trigger a sense of urgency to respond, no matter how preliminary it might be, so that the users would start thinking what does it mean, and how does it feel to be in others' senses of social connectivity.

- What exact behaviour should I choose? What are the rationales for each of them?
  - kin recognition by statistical learning
    - Kin recognition is one of the building blocks of sociality between animals, and in many cases, the learning of kin recognition is also shared with recognising all sorts of social others. In "Life", the goosling chicks respond to their parents' calls by moving towards them, even though they have to drop from a cliff and risk breaking their necks. What is embedded in this sense of urgency and non-optional bondedness? 
    - I will write an arduino program to mimic the process of kin recognition by statistical learning. Assuming vocal recognition as a primacy cue as is the case with (insert species; look back at your papers!), I aim to trigger a motor response when a certain reading from the ultrasonic sensor reaches a certain frequency. The trigger of the motor signifies the animal's recognition of this vocal frequency, and the senses felt by the user represents the animal's compulsion to act.
    - This is a frivolous imitation of kin recognition because it in no way represents the cognitive process of an instinct. As humans we think about sensory stimuli and make interpretations out of them. However, I propose this prototype is still worth trying because it invites such imagination.  
  - alarm call
    - Alarm call is exemplified as one of the classic cooperative, or alturistic behaviours in the animal kingdom. By making alarm calls, the individual increases others' chances of servival but essentially exposes themselves to the danger, at most tiems the attention of predators. 
    - An arduino program will be made to sense the sound of the environment; above a certain threshold the buzzers, a red LED light and a motor will be triggered for a sense of urgency to trigger alarm call. A more advanced version can be developed if there can be another motor, the predator, which moves towards the direction of the sound source, so that the user is more prone to danger when they make an alarm call response, but the call is triggered nonetheless. 
    - This example may be well-suited to express the vulnerability of animals with a behavioural tendency to make alarm calls. As the prototype will show, human-induced noise can also be included in the noises beyond the threshold, resulting in false alarms. In some cases this induces habituation, where the animal becomes oblivious of alarm-triggering cues and stop making alarm calls at all. This completely changes their behaviour reprotoire, makes them vulnerable to all sorts of dangers that they were evolved to be sensitive of.

- How is empathy-machine different from other forms of empathy-triggering mechanisms?
  - By posing this question I am trying to compare the sort of empathy felt in novels/movies/documentaries with empathy one can create in a design prototype. Unlike visual art, which involves long-term sensory immersion and engagement, at most times with a story, the experience of an empathy machine, at least with my current technical competency, is inherently more instant.  With a limited time frame, how can I do something unique about empathy that is different from reading a novel?
