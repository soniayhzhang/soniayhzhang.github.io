Under construction!

- What is empathy, really? What is the purpose of feeling other beings' perceptions? More specifically, senses?
- What are the ethical implications of empathy machine? As designers we are introducing a new sensory experience to users, something completely new to them - they are relying on our expertise to renew their conceptions of animals. If we make an inaccurate translation, to what extent are we responsible for its implications?
- How about machines that empathise pain? Pain is a powerful feeling that triggers a sense of commonness and unity. However, does ethical constrains limit us from developing such ideas?
- How to have a concept that matters? A non-random feeling, moving beyond the sense of curiosity?

Conceptualising...
- What do I want to empathise?
  - Sociality: can we experience the social universe of an animal through our sensory percrptions? Social learning is a cognitive process, many scientists would say. But can we mimic the sense of connectivity, bond, urgency to respond...that are described as the instinct for many animals?
- Why is this important?
  - Human is frequently described as a social animal, that advanced sociality is what made us human. The primacy of social interaction, the longing for social bonds might be something shared between us and animals. In this case, I am not trying to make people experience something new and novel senses, but rather to trigger something deep in common, translated to the five senses of the human faculty. 
    - For example, kin recognition through statistical learning is shared through multiple animal species; some comparative psychologists believe human infants share the same learning mechanism.
 - Social connections also expose animals' vulnerabilities. In many contexts, offspring respond to their species-specific callings no matter how dangerous it is. 
 - However, if social connection is felt through instinct instead of interpretation of meaning, as us humans experience, how can I create something that empathises instinct? Is instinct truly a mechanistic response to external stimuli? Does it also involve some kind of consciousness and thinking process that science nowadays is simply ill-equipped to discover and measure? I hope this ptototype opens this question to the user. It is not to provide an accurate mimic of social connection, but to trigger a sense of urgency to respond, no matter how preliminary it might be, so that the users would start thinking what does it mean, and how does it feel to be in others' senses of social connectivity.
