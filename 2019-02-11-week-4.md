- What is empathy, really? What is the purpose of feeling other beings' perceptions? More specifically, senses?
- What are the ethical implications of empathy machine? As designers we are introducing a new sensory experience to users, something completely new to them - they are relying on our expertise to renew their conceptions of animals. If we make an inaccurate translation, to what extent are we responsible for its implications?
- How about machines that empathise pain? Pain is a powerful feeling that triggers a sense of commonness and unity. However, does ethical constrains limit us from developing such ideas?
- How to have a concept that matters? A non-random feeling, moving beyond the sense of curiosity?
